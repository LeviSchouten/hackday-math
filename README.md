## Website for Math practice

This will be a simple website, which will -- at it's core -- generate random Math exercises for the user to 
practice with.

### TODO's
- Setting up Backend with Express
  - *GET* : Randomly generated Math exercise (+,  -,  x) 
  - Add a random a fact about the correct answer to the response, using this API http://numbersapi.com/#42(sometimes slow, start fetching at start)
  - If there is no random fact for that number add just a random fact to it using this API: https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/ 

- Setting up Frontend with React
  - *CARD*: fetch data and generate *Exercise* component with that data
  - *EXERCISE*: Display exercise and check if correct (seperate component?)

- General Setup
  - Configure and install ESlint


### BONUS
- Keep score
- Daily Challenge
- Improve UX(mouseless)
- Difficulty levels(backend)
- Add more operators(divide?)
- Leaderboard(users)
