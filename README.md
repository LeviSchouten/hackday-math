practice with.

### TODO's

  - *GET* : Randomly generated Math exercise (+,  -,  x) 

- Setting up Frontend with React
  - *CARD*: fetch data and generate *Exercise* component with that data
  - *EXERCISE*: Display exercise and check if correct (seperate component?)

- General Setup
  - Configure and install ESlint


### BONUS
